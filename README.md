# Walmart Sales Analysis

## Business Objective
Analyze Walmart store-level sales data to identify revenue drivers,
seasonal patterns, and economic sensitivities to support forecasting
and strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Walmart Sales Dataset
- Weekly sales data for 45 stores
- Includes holiday flags and macroeconomic indicators

## Key Questions
1. Which stores generate the most revenue?
2. How do sales change over time?
3. What is the impact of holidays?
4. Which stores are most volatile?
5. How do economic factors affect sales?
6. Can we forecast weekly sales?

## Methods
- SQL aggregation
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Time-series analysis
- Linear regression forecasting

## Key Insights
- Revenue concentration among top stores
- Strong seasonality during holiday periods
- Varying store-level volatility
- Sensitivity to unemployment and fuel prices

## Recommendations
- Prioritize inventory and staffing during peak periods
- Monitor high-volatility stores more closely
- Incorporate economic indicators into forecasting models

## Data Source & Limitations

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and consists of multiple relational tables representing Walmart sales, store metadata, and external economic indicators.

While the dataset is not officially published by Walmart and has limited public documentation, it provides a realistic structure for practicing data engineering, SQL joins, and KPI analysis.

Any insights derived from this analysis should be interpreted as exploratory rather than definitive business conclusions.
